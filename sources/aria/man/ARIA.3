.Sh DESCRIPTION
\fBAria (Academia, Research Institute and Agency)\fP is a symmetrical encryption algorithm developed in 2003 by a team of South Korean researchers.
In December 2004, ATS(Agency for Technology and Standards) of KoreastandardizedARIAas â€˜128-bit Block Encryption AlgorithmARIA(KS X 1213)
Since 2011 it is an encryption supported by the communication protocol TLS (Transport Layer Security).
It is a 128bit block encryption using three different key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
This implementation provide all the necessary functions to perform Aria encryption and decryption.
